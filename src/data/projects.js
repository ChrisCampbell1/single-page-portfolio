    description: "As an avid skier, I've always wanted a platform like Après to exist. There are all sorts of places online where you can buy and sell used items but I haven't found one that focuses on winter sports. I created Après as a marketplace where users can create listings for the gear they no longer want. Potential buyers can filter those listings to find gear that they are looking for and connect with sellers to purchase their listings.",
